001: ip.IP.code_queue
Queue behaviour changed to just running
This means that other commands do not work such as abort

Fix: # TODO
We will implement another queue using the python Queue class
And somehow teach IPython to run this queue.

Maybe look at https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/master/IPython/deathrow/twshell.py
